# faceRecognition

1.	“Capture” file detects the face and saves the image into our hard-drive while also creating a csv file (as database to be compared for recognising) 
    with the name and encodings updated of the facial image captured.
2.	“Detect” file detects and recognises the face and displays the name on-screen.
